StatChaser.com

Website that allows the user to compare any two NBA players, active or retired, in any of 20 statistical categories, based on their last N games. Based on user input, a graph is generated with curves representing each player over time as well as two tables that show the percent difference between their career average and their average in their last N games.

Developed using the Django framework. The graph and the selection menus were implemented using the Chart.js and Select2.js JavaScript libraries. The data was manipulated using python and NumPy and supplied by nba_api, an API client package for accessing APIs from the NBA website. Launched on SSD Linux server and maintained using Apache.
